# VM API

This is a project used for testing projects that use cloud APIs.
Currently extremely disorganized, but it works for testing.

It uses podman for creating mock ssh servers with 1gb and 1 cpu.
It only works on unix machines.

To run this, you need to build the image at the docker folder and tag it as 'ssh_server'
